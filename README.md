# Bloom

Bloom is a remote trauma support service from Chayn, a global charity supporting survivors of abuse across borders. Bloom is our flagship product; a free, web-based support service designed for anyone who has experienced or is currently experiencing domestic or sexual abuse. Through a combination of online video-based courses, anonymous interaction and 1:1 chat, Bloom aims to provide tailored information, guidance, everyday tools, and comforting words to cope with traumatic events. ðŸ’–

## Local development

### Prerequisites

- NodeJS v16.x
- Yarn v1.x
- Docker

### Install dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

### Create `.env` file

Environment variables must be added to a local `.env` file. Create this file using `.env.example` for reference, and adding values for local development.

If this is your first time running the system as a volunteer, please get in touch with the team to get access required variables.

### Run locally (with Docker) - RECOMMENDED

The project is containerized and can be run solely in docker - both the PostgreSQL database and NestJS app. To run the backend locally, make sure your system has Docker installed - you may need Docker Desktop if using a Mac.

First make sure the docker app is running (just open the app). Then run

```bash
docker-compose up
```

You should see this in the shell output:

```shell
Listening on localhost:35001, CTRL+C to stop
```

_Note: you can use an application like Postman to test the apis locally_

**Run the app**

```bash
yarn start:dev
```

You should see this in the shell output:

```shell
Listening on localhost:35001, CTRL+C to stop
```

### Database migrations

A migration in TypeORM is a single file with SQL queries to update a database schema as updates/additions are made. Read more about migrations [here](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/master/docs/migrations.md).

Migrations are automatically run when the app is built docker (locally) or Heroku for staging and production apps.

**You'll need to generate and run a migration each time you add or update a database field or table.**

To generate a new migration

```bash
yarn migration:generate
```

To run (apply) migrations

```bash
yarn migration:run
```

To revert a migration

```bash
yarn migration:revert
```

**New environment variables must be added to Heroku before release.**

### Run unit tests

To run all unit tests

```bash
yarn test:unit
```

To have your unit tests running in the background as you change code:

```bash
yarn test:unit:watch
```

### Formatting and linting

To run linting

```bash
yarn lint
```

To lint and fix

```bash
yarn lint:fix
```

Formatting and linting is provided by ESLint and Prettier (see the relevant configs for details).

Workspace settings for VSCode are included for consistent linting and formatting.

### Seed Local Database

If you're a volunteer, the way to add data to your local database is to seed it using a backup file. Please get in touch with the team to get access to the backup file.

If you're staff and have access to Heroku, you also have the option to seed the database via the following script. Before you start, make sure:

1. bloom-local-db container is running in Docker
2. you are logged into the Heroku via your terminal. Read more about the Heroku Cli [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
3. Replace <HEROKU_APP_NAME> with the correct Heroku app name in the `seed-local-db.sh file`
4. Run `chmod +x ./seed-local-db.sh` in your terminal to make the file executable

After the above has been confirmed, run

```bash
bash seed-local-db.sh
```
For a more detailed explanation of this project's key concepts and architecture, please visit the [/docs directory](https://github.com/chaynHQ/bloom-backend/tree/develop/docs).

## Git flow and deployment

Create new branches from the `develop` base branch. There is no need to run the build command before pushing changes to GitHub, simply push and create a pull request for the new branch. GitHub Actions will run build and linting tasks automatically. Rebase and merge feature/bug branches into `develop`.

This will trigger an automatic deployment to the staging app by Heroku.

When changes have been tested in staging, merge `staging` into `main`. This will trigger an automatic deployment to the production app by Heroku.

## Swagger

Swagger automatically reflects all of the endpoints in the app, showing their urls and example request and response objects.

To access Swagger simply run the project and visit http://localhost:35001/swagger

## License

Bloom and all of Chayn's projects are open source.
The core tech stack included here is open source however some external integrations used in the project require subscriptions.
